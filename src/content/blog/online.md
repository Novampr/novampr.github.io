Is this thing on? Of course it is why wouldn't it be. Hey there! My name is Nova, but online I commonly go by Aurora. This is my new site! Yeah there's an old one... *it's not very good*.

However! We are back, greater then ever, back into the swing of a website. It'll probably be quiet for a bit, maybe I'll add my library project BrigadierExtras here...

Anyway, glad to see you here!
